** Definition

A group is a set, G, together with an operation • 
(called the group law of G) that combines any two elements a and b to form another element, 
denoted a • b or ab. To qualify as a group, 
the set and operation, (G, •), must satisfy four requirements known as the group axioms:

- *Closure*
  For all a, b in G, the result of the operation, a • b, is also in G.b
- *Associativity*
  For all a, b and c in G, (a • b) • c = a • (b • c).
- *Identity*
  There exists an element e in G such that, for every element a in G, the equation e • a = a • e = a holds. 
  Such an element is unique (see below), and thus one speaks of the identity element.
- *Inverse*
  For each a in G, there exists an element b in G, commonly denoted a^-1 (or −a, if the operation is denoted "+"), 
  such that a • b = b • a = e, where e is the identity element.
